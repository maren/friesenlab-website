# Title: Preparing an experiment / project report

## Rationale
Communicating scientific processes & results is critical. The report should be started in the early stages of project design and should capture the rationale and decisions that were made along the way. It should be a self-contained document that explains what was done, why it was done, and what the results and conclusions were clearly and concisely. The report should enable another scientist to reproduce the work that you did.

## Time estimate
* Roughly 20-40 hours. Note that much of this work will be usable directly in preparing publications!
