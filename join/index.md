We are always seeking motivated, talented scientists to join our lab. We are particularly interested in recruiting future leaders in the field of beneficial plant-microbe interactions, and in people interested in integrating theoretical, computational, and empirical approaches. I accept people with diverse backgrounds who are seeking an environment where they will develop intellectual independence within the context of strong collaboration, interdisciplinary relationships, and mutual respect. I expect members of my group to write research proposals, coauthor publications, give scientific presentations, be involved in science outreach, and have fun.

If you are interested in exploring opportunities with us, please send your CV and a brief (~1pg) statement of interest to Maren. We receive a lot of inquiries and do not respond to blanket applications, but _sometimes emails fall through the cracks so if you are sincerely interested in our work and do not hear back within a few weeks please contact me again._ 

# Undergraduates 
My lab normally has several undergraduates who work with some combination of plants, microbes, molecular biology, bioinformatics, image analysis, and video game design.

# Graduate students
I can accept graduate students through the Molecular Plant Science program as well as the departmental graduate programs in Plant Pathology and Crop and Soil Science. **Please contact me well in advance of applying to the grad program for guidance**. I encourage potential graduate students to apply for independent fellowships, again, please contact me.

# Postdocs
I am always looking for talented people to join my group and welcome the opportunity to help you apply for independent funding through various agencies, in addition to grant support for ongoing projects in my lab. I follow Googleâ€™s strategy of encouraging postdocs to spend 20% of their time on creative new projects distinct from their main project.
