Welcome to the Friesen Lab website!

Our lab goals: 
1. To understand the molecular, physiological, ecological, and evolutionary processes that shape plant associations with nitrogen-fixing bacteria. 
2. To ground our work in quantitative models and to integrate data and theory in the pursuit of understanding both agricultural and wild systems.
3. To cultivate an open and collaborative research environment that inspires each of us to do our best work and pursue our intellectual passions.

We are fascinated by beneficial plant-microbe interactions, particularly those between nitrogen-fixing bacteria and plants. Much of our work is in the legume-rhizobia system, utilizing natural genetic variation in both partners to ask questions about adaptation and conflict. We are also working in grass-associative nitrogen fixation systems to understand the functioning of interrelationships between plants and their rhizosphere communities and the evolutionary stability and molecular basis of these interactions. Finally, we use mathematical models to explore the conceptual underpinnings of mutualisms with the goal of integrating models with empirical data to understand fundamental processes acting at molecular, organismal, population/community, and ecosystem scales.
