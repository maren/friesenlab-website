Welcome to the Friesen Lab website!

We use a variety of approaches to understand the molecular, physiological, ecological, and evolutionary processes that shape plant associations with nitrogen-fixing bacteria. We aim to ground our work in quantitative models and to integrate data and theory in pursuit of understanding both agricultural and wild systems.
